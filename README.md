# BooksSpring5webapp
A small and simple app using SpringFramework5, SpringMVC, SpringData and ThymeLeaf. The Focus is more a Simple Backend, Database Mapping and other simple Features of Spring5.
Database is just setup as H2 Database Engine.
It's not meant to be beautiful. For now only the findAll() methods are implemented.
